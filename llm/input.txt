The United States and India recently announced a rollback
of certain tariffs imposed during previous trade disputes. The move is 
expected to boost bilateral trade, particularly in sectors like agriculture,
electronics, and manufacturing. Economists believe this step will enhance 
market access and reduce costs for exporters on both sides, while signaling 
improved geopolitical alignment between the two democracies.
